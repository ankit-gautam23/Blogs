Here are some changes you might need to make to the code to ensure that it can be safely used in a production environment:

Ensure that the API endpoint is protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JWT authentication, to prevent unauthorized access to the configuration file.
Make sure that the Flask application is running with the appropriate permissions to modify the configuration file. In a production environment, the Flask application may be running as a different user than the one that owns the configuration file, which means that it may not have write access to the file. To address this, you may need to modify the file permissions or run the Flask application with elevated privileges.
Consider storing the configuration file in a more secure location, such as an encrypted file system, to prevent unauthorized access to the file.
Consider adding error handling to the API endpoint to ensure that the configuration file is not corrupted or damaged in the event of an error. For example, you might want to add a try-except block to handle any exceptions that might be raised during the file modification process.
You might also want to add logging functionality to the Flask application to track any changes made to the configuration file.
It's important to thoroughly test any changes you make to the code before deploying it to a production environment, to ensure that it works as expected and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or other issues
