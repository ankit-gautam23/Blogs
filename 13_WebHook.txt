What is a webhook?

Imagine this: You have a website or an application, and you want it to automatically do things without you having to trigger them manually.

That's where webhooks come in!

Webhooks are like little messengers that allow one system to send a message or data to another system in real time whenever a specific event happens.

It's like getting a notification on your phone when someone comments on your social media post or when you receive an email.

Webhooks work similarly but for systems and applications.

A webhook is a way for one system to send a message or data to another system in real-time whenever something important happens.

There are many ways that webhooks can be helpful.

For example, you can use webhooks to automatically update a database or trigger an action when a form is submitted on your website.

They can also be used to send notifications or alerts, such as when a new user signs up for your service or when an error occurs in your system.

One of the cool things about webhooks is that they make your website or application more dynamic and responsive.

You don't have to keep polling or manually updating your system. Instead, webhooks allow your systems to communicate and work together seamlessly, saving you time and resources.

A straightforward way to implement webhooks is using Azure Functions with HTTP triggers.

This is the approach I'm using to implement my Patreon integration with GitHub.

Patreon has webhook support that will hit my Azure Function endpoints, and then I can run my business logic.
