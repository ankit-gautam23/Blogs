PostgreSQL and MySQL are both popular open-source relational database management systems (RDBMS) that are commonly used in monolithic applications. While both databases have their strengths and weaknesses, there are several reasons why you might choose PostgreSQL over MySQL for a .NET monolithic application:

 - ACID compliance: PostgreSQL is known for its strong ACID compliance, which ensures that database transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. This means that data is always stored in a consistent state, and that any transactions that fail are rolled back automatically. MySQL is also ACID-compliant, but some users have reported issues with consistency and durability in certain situations.

 - Advanced features: PostgreSQL has a number of advanced features that are not available in MySQL, including support for advanced data types such as arrays, JSON, and XML, as well as advanced indexing options, full-text search, and geospatial data support.

 - Performance: While MySQL is known for its speed and scalability, PostgreSQL has made significant improvements in recent years and is now considered a highly performant database. In particular, PostgreSQL's ability to handle complex queries and its support for concurrency make it a good choice for applications that require a high level of performance.

 - Security: PostgreSQL has a strong focus on security, with features such as row-level security, encryption, and user-defined access controls. While MySQL also has a range of security features, PostgreSQL's focus on security makes it a good choice for applications that handle sensitive data.

 - Community support: Both PostgreSQL and MySQL have large and active communities, but PostgreSQL is known for its strong community support and active development. This means that there are plenty of resources available for learning and troubleshooting, and that new features and updates are released on a regular basis.

Overall, while both PostgreSQL and MySQL are good choices for monolithic .NET applications, PostgreSQL's strong ACID compliance, advanced features, performance, security, and community support make it a compelling choice for many applications.
